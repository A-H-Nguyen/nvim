# nvim
My personal NeoVim setup!

## Installing
Before doing anything, install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).

Then, clone into this directory:
```
~/.config
```

Hopefully, because I named this repo "nvim," I won't need to change the name of the clone folder.

## To Do:
I deleted Alpha in favor of dashboard-nvim. While the default Hyper theme is pretty good, I want to sit down and customize it more.

I should get rid of vim fugitive because I never use it.

Replace lualine with [feline](https://github.com/freddiehaddad/feline.nvim/?tab=readme-ov-file) and set up the [gitsigns](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim/) plugin.
